# Changelog

## 3.2.2 - 04-29-2019

- BBCode URL/BBVideo Wizard is now a modal/overlay, to solve some issues where it might have been obscured from view.
- Ensure BBVideos are sorted alphabetically in the BBCode Wizard's examples drop down menu.
- Added Slovak translation.
- Additional minor code improvements.

## 3.2.1 - 2018-06-07

- Improved BBvideo's compatibility with phpBB Media Embed PlugIn extension. For best results, install phpBB Media Embed Plugin extension to have the ability to manage which sites area allowed and to control parsing plain URLs.
- ABBC3 now has a BBCode entry in the ACP for the Pipe Tables plugin. This way you can arrange where you want the Pipe Tables BBCode to appear in the BBCode bar. You may also choose to not display the Pipe Table BBCode on the posting page, or you can delete the BBCode to remove the Pipe Tables functionality.
- Fixed an issue since 3.2.0 where deleting the `[BBvideo]` and `[hidden]` BBCodes did not stop them from still being *secretly* available to continue being used. Now, if they get deleted, they are functionally gone (unless you completely reinstall ABBC3).

## 3.2.0 - 2018-01-20

- Documentation for Advanced BBCodes added to the BBCode FAQ page
- Added Tables support in posts (using s9e/TextFormatter's Pipe Tables plugin)
- Compatible with phpBB Media Embed extension, added a BBCode button for [MEDIA] tag.
- [BBvideo] deprecated:
    - BBvideo is now an alias for the [MEDIA] tag, part of the Media Embed feature bundled with phpBB (you do NOT need to install phpBB Media Embed extension to work).
    - Many more sites and media services are supported through the Media Embed feature bundled with phpBB.
    - Many old BBVideo exclusive sites are no longer supported (most of which are dead and gone anyways). `5min.com, allocine.fr, clipfish.de, clipmoon.com, cnet.com, colbertnation.com, crackle.com, dotsub.com, ebaumsworld.com, g4tv.com, gameprotv.com, howcast.com, maker.tv, moddb.com, mpora.com, myspace.com, myvideo.de, on.aol.com, photobucket.com, sapo.pt, screenr.com, snotr.com, spike.com, streetfire.net, thedailyshow.cc.com, tu.tv, tudou.com, viddler.com, videogamer.com`
    - Custom video sizing is no longer available. phpBB's bundled Media embedding has predetermined hard-coded video sizes.
    - Raw URLs for compatible media sites will automatically be converted into content even without being wrapped in the BBvideo tag.
    - The original URLs will no longer be displayed if they can be converted to embedded content.
    - All Posts and PM's will be re-parsed after updating, over time using CRON jobs to fix broken posts with BBvideos.
    - Incompatible BBvideos will remain broken (sorry 'bout that, but moving on usually means leaving old stuff behind).
- Improved align BBCode when used on non-text like images, videos, etc.
- Show AJAX loading indicators while loading BBCode wizards
- Improved ABBC3 deletion. Now if you delete ABBC3, all the BBCodes it installed will no longer be displayed on the posting pages, returning the BBCodes toolbar to the default appearance. You may then choose to manually display or delete each of the BBCodes in the ACP Posting page.
